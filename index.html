        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello I'm Avery Miller, I originate from the small town of Rossville, KS but my head 
          has always been in the clouds. From a very young age my favorite phrase has always been "What if??"
          That question has most recently brought me to my journey of becoming a software developer. This is a 
          goal of mine to not only improve my quality of life through income and available free time but by obtaining 
          a skill that i can use in my at home engineering. I spend most of my time tinkering with projects at home. 
          Whether that involves my car, my many plants, or my new found hobby of 3D printing. Learning to code will 
          give me the ability to step up my at home projects to the next level aswell as to make my mother proud knowing
          I have achieved a rewarding and stable career. <b>Bring on the extended course!!</b>
